# Philosophers Timeline

A little app to demonstrate the lifetimes of philosophers visually.

# Data

Original app used a Google Sheet as a public data source, which allowed someone with write access to add dates without redeploying the site.

This had the advantage of not needing any backend. However Google now requires an API Key to get data even from public Sheets.

Therfore I have created a new version which uses local hardcoded data to get it back up and running.

## Future Improvements

Allow edition of data by a user without redeploying, i.e. find an easy way for someone with no development knowledge to change the data.
